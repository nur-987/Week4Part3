1) FuncAction - Code with instructor practice.
 
Func and Action examples

to enter the library you need to be a student of the class (need to verify using some roll no etc.) but you can only issue one book at a time. Give the details of student after the book is issued. 
Use exception handling to show the error message  
*use generic class - NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

Suppose you are working in an MNC.  after your joining there will be a probation period of 6 months, in this period you are drawing only 80% of your monthly salary. after that you will get the full salary.    Every month from your salary you have:

3. 5% to health insurance after paying PF               
4. 7% to Mutual Funds after paying Health insurance.  
Now calculate the total amount of money you will get after all these investments in a year.
use exception handling to show the error msg. and create  generic class to store the data
